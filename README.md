# Valuetainment Store Landing Page

## About the Project

This landing page was created as part of the task for the Junior Frontend Developer position at Genesys Softwares. The objective was to develop a landing page based on the provided Figma design, ensuring responsiveness across multiple devices and incorporating animations to enhance user experience.

I focused on writing **clean**, **scalable**, and **organized** code by breaking the project down into modular components. While the scale of the project may be small, I took a **future-proofing** approach with scalability in mind. The project is responsive for small, medium, large, and extra-large devices, using **default Tailwind CSS breakpoints**. I also adhered to **color theory** principles and chose **red** as the primary theme color to align with the design.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its powerful out-of-the-box features, including **image optimization**, **font optimization**, **routing**, and **error boundary handling**.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for a clean, utility-first approach to styling and ensuring a responsive design across devices.
- **Framer Motion**: Integrated to create smooth and declarative animations that work well with the React framework.
- **Lenis**: Added for **smooth scrolling**, providing an easy-to-implement solution for scroll behavior.

## Features

### 1. **Responsive Design**

- The layout adapts seamlessly to small, medium, large, and extra-large screen sizes.
- Default Tailwind CSS breakpoints were used to ensure the design is responsive across devices like laptops, iPads, and mobile phones.

### 2. **Animations and Interactions**

- **Menu Button**: A sliding menu animation that opens from the right side, adding a sleek transition effect.
- **Hero Slider**: Features smooth, animated transitions between slides, with a **pause-on-hover** interaction for better control.
- **Magnifying Lens Effect**: Hovering over an image in the hero section triggers a magnifying lens effect.
- **Text/Link Rotating Animation**: Links rotate on hover to provide an engaging visual effect.
- **Parallax Scroll**: Applied a parallax scrolling effect on the books section to enhance the depth and dynamism of the page.
- **Word Reveal on Scroll Progress**: Words are revealed progressively as the user scrolls through the page.
- **Animated Buttons**: Two call-to-action buttons with subtle yet captivating hover animations.
- **Magnetic Social Links**: The social media links in the footer feature a magnetic effect on hover, drawing the cursor towards them for a unique user interaction.

## Known Issues

- **Magnifying Lens Overflow**: The magnifying lens effect overflows on the right side of the hero slider image. This will be resolved in future updates.
- **Hero Slider Speed Issue**: Occasionally, the speed of the hero slider decreases unexpectedly. I am working on fixing this.
- **Image optimization Issue**:
I could not perform manual image optimization, which is causing higher Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). I need more time to address this issue, but I can resolve it effectively.
